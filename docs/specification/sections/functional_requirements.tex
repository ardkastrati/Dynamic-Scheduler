		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Database}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Initialize database
			\item Read data from statistic database
			\item Write data into statistic database
			\item Write data into bookkeeping database
			\item Pass data do data mining module
			%\item Files will be placed after computation as usable files for plotting.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\subsubsection{Data mining}
	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Read data from database memory
				\item Process task queries from scheduler

			\end{itemize}
	
		%\subsubsection{Queue database} %into scheduler
	
		%	\begin{itemize}
		%		\item Read-functions for the queue file.
		%		\item Write-functions for the queue file.
		%	\end{itemize}
		
		
		\subsubsection{Bookkeeping database}
	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Bookkeeping should be conducted for the following events:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Task appears
					\item Task started
					\item Task finished 
					\item optional: Interconnection between processes
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{itemize}
	
		\subsubsection{Statistics database}
	
			\begin{itemize}
