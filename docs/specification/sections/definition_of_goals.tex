\section{Definition of goals}
	\subsection{Must-have}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The dynamic scheduler can be integrated into scientific code, which provides the following interface:
				\subitem code\_preprocessing\_master(run arguments):set of initial tasks
				\subitem code\_preprocessing\_slave(void):void
				\subitem code\_postprocessing\_master(void):void
				\subitem code\_postprocessing\_slave(void):void
				\subitem run\_task(task):run result
			\item The dynamic scheduler can be integrated into scientific code, which uses the following interfaces:
				\subitem place\_task(task)
			%\item The program must be able to receive different task-structures (task data types). The task data type must provide the task\_params interface:
				%\subitem int task\_type\_length
				%\subitem int num\_stat\_task\_params
				%\subitem int result\_type\_length
				%\subitem int stat\_task\_params
				%\subitem type task\_type\_unit
				%\subitem type task\_type
				%\subitem type result\_type\_unit
				%\subitem type result\_type
				
			\item The program must be able to execute scientific code.%call or execute
			\item The scheduler provides a task stealing algorithm in order to reduce the idle time of processes%must-have%
			\item Must provide different scheduling strategies.
			\item Must provide a strategy interface.
			\item Must be able to bookkeep following events of each task:
				\subitem task appears
				\subitem task started
				\subitem task finished
			\item Must perform data mining on collected statistics
			\item Collected data must be visualized
			\item Estimate the runtime of each task
			\item Must collect following statistical data for each task:
				\subitem the runtime of the task depending on task parameters
			%\item Accumulate all results during the computation and store them in a database
			\item It must be possible to use variable numbers of parameters for statistics
			\item The dynamic scheduler must be callable from the command line
			\item Several scheduler instances should be able to communicate with each other
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Nice-to-have}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Must be able to dynamically choose between provided strategies.
			\item Must be able to bookkeep following events of each task:
				\subitem interconnection between precesses
			\item Provide a GUI to configure the program and generate a MOAB Workload Manager shell script
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Demarcation criterion}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Dynamically choosing the scheduling strategy doesn't use adaptive learning
			\item Scheduler should be able to dynamically change its MPI-world
		\end{itemize}
