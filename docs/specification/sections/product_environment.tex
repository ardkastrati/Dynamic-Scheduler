\section{Product environment}
	\subsection{Software}
	The dynamic scheduler runs on the bwUniCluster from the Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC) with the following software environment:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unix based operation systems (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x installation on each node of the bwUniCluster)
		\item KITE 2.0 cluster management software
		\item Lustre parallel distributed file system
		\item Massage Passing Interface (MPI) support
		\item Moab Cluster Suit Workload Manager
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Hardware}
	The dynamic scheduler runs on the bwUniCluster from the Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC). Computers of the bwUniCluster have following hardware configurations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 2 login nodes with 16 cores each at a theoretical top performance of 332,8 GFLOPS and 64 GB main memory per node 
			\item 512 calculation nodes with 16 cores each at a theoretical top performance of 332,8 GFLOPS and 64 GB main memory per node
			\item 8 calculation nodes with 32 Cores each at a theoretical top performance of 614,4 GFLOPS and 1 TB main memory per node
			\item Interconnection network with InfiniBand 4X FDR Interconnect
		\end{itemize}
